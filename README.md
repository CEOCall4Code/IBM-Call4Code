The Big Data for Wildfire Monitoring and Prediction is an IoT-based Cloud Architecture that shows in real time the affected area throught an    Area Map Dashboard.
A CloudServer receives data from IoT sensor on the field also can guide area occupants about the emergencyÂ´s status  and drive drone ,  firefighter robots to combat the fire.
